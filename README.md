This is a simple Google Colab notebook made by a high school student for generating images using Stable Diffusion XL.

• This notebook uses Transformers and Diffusers as the major parts to generate images, as well as ControlNet, Inpainting, and IP-Adapter.

• This notebook also has the ability to download and load images, LoRA weights, and VAE using URLs, but make sure the links are the direct ones.

• **This notebook also has the ability to connect to your Google Drive**. (can be disabled)

• I made this notebook as user-friendly as possible, simplifying its complexity and making the UI easy to understand.

• You have the ability to pass your CivitAI's token in this notebook, but make sure to **never share it with anyone**.

**Please use this notebook responsibly, only for artistic approach or looking for inspirations. Creating deepfakes then uploading them online are strictly prohibited.**
